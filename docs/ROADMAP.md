# MailSchema roadmap

The [0.3 specification bundle](../specifications/map-0.3/README.md) governs new work; the [architecture decision](MAP-0.3-DESIGN.md) explains its boundaries without adding requirements. The bundle contains Core, the HTTP and experimental capability bindings, four draft contracts, conformance skeletons, and the generated `-00` candidate. The site builds a coherent 0.3 reader, Registry, examples and tools experience from those sources. The legacy package and implementation evidence below remains explicitly historical until replacements are implemented and verified.

## Distribution reconciliation, 21 October 2026

The individual Internet-Draft `draft-mailschema-mail-action-protocol-00` was posted to Datatracker on 8 October 2026 (submission 169964, document date 7 October, expires 11 April 2027). No specification change has landed since, so it matches the current 0.3 bundle. Venue consultations remain outstanding, and the draft is not an adopted standard. SML consultation concerns the email container; its charter excludes domain vocabulary and post-extraction actions. DISPATCH is the recorded venue-discovery route. Keep public draft date/artifact URLs, author confirmation and final rendered review together before upload. Package Registry declarations, runtime-conformance reports and independent interoperability remain separate evidence.

## Objective

Make MAP a useful open standard for service actions carried through email, with MailSchema as its specification, type Registry and implementation ecosystem. Prove it in products we control, record exact evidence, accept external contributions through reviewed Registry data, and state maturity and ownership exactly.

## Invariants

1. MailSchema is the project and ecosystem. Mail Action Protocol is the specification.
2. MAP layers typed action descriptions on email and Structured Email. For 0.3, a trusted implementation maps them to existing service operations; there is no universal execution endpoint or request/result envelope.
3. Receiving an email grants no authority for credentialed operations: a client selects its service connection independently and uses an existing credential. The optional experimental capability binding permits only contract-approved, limited bearer actions after Core's qualifying DKIM, strict alignment, recipient and host-policy checks. Possession of that URL remains transferable bearer authority.
4. Human-readable email and normal service interfaces remain available.
5. MAP introduces no mandatory global identity provider, custom DNS mechanism, central runtime lookup or universal policy language.
6. Registry records bind definitions, versions, operation IDs and implementation evidence. Registry presence does not grant runtime authority.
7. Draft maturity, ownership and implementation evidence are stated exactly. Common-ownership dogfood is not presented as independent adoption.
8. Credentials and private operational data stay outside public artifacts.

## Delivery status

The branch updates the site to MAP 0.3 in development and production builds. Browser and build verification precede merge and deployment; no package version is changed.

## Next

**MAP 0.3 working-draft candidate:** The canonical sources, Registry and site
are reconciled in the local branch. Nitrosend's controlled product send, signed
receipt, native review, service decision and resulting SES delivery have been
observed. The candidate has passed repository verification and the generated
Internet-Draft renders cleanly; these observations support a first working
draft, not full runtime conformance or independent interoperability. Publish
implementation reports only when their exact sources and limits can be linked.
The table also tracks Nitrosend deployment and later milestones, which have
separate release decisions.

| Area | Current state | Next check or follow-on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Producer and receiver | An owner-only hold ran through Nitrosend's `NotificationEmailJob`, `Notification::Sender`, durable message admission and SES. Its original signed SNS callback entered the isolated local controller; the received S3 MIME matched the persisted outbound MAP description, passed receiver verification and bound to the pending native inbox review. The temporary capture subscription was removed. Development's local provider was bypassed for that one isolated send process. | Check the production platform sender and inbound configuration. This is one first-party chain, not general interoperability. |
| Native human interaction | A product-delivered campaign appeared as a verified pending native card in the running local inbox at desktop and mobile widths, with its original email and ordinary links retained. GET and HEAD of the local links left the hold and delivery untouched. The current exact-version request was then approved through the native inbox API under an authorized owner test bearer. Its one-recipient campaign completed through SES; the receiving S3 store contains the matching original email. The campaign and native inbox both read back terminal state. A headless browser then exercised lost-response handling against the isolated API: a still-pending request kept its uncertainty message and did not retry, while an initial pending view of an already-approved request resolved to the real terminal readback. The intercepted POSTs were not forwarded, so this did not prove an in-flight commit. | Review the public HTTPS route before deploying the inbox; retain the distinction between UI recovery and a concurrent service race. This was an operator rehearsal, not a claim that the owner clicked the UI. |
| Progressive enhancement | The native card is primary and the collapsed Original email retains ordinary review links. The product-delivered message displayed both, and its local approve/decline GET and HEAD routes had no effects. Unsupported types retain the ordinary email. | Exercise absent connections, failed trust, stale service state and native presentation failure through the running UI. |
| Agent host | The local MCP server returned the product-delivered campaign message as a pending first-party action with `approve` and `decline` descriptions, while `decision_policy` remained `human_only` and `can_execute: false`. Earlier it withheld messages with mismatched recipients or bindings. | Apply connection permissions and host policy before any agent-decidable contract is claimed; model output never stands in for human approval. |
| Enforcement and recovery | Focused local tests cover selected stale, expiry, repeated-decision and spending-cap cases. The owner-inbox campaign decision leaves the reusable template unapproved. A cancelled campaign now presents its still-saved approval hold as withdrawn in both campaign and verified inbox views, hides decision operations, and refuses preview and customer or operator decisions under the existing service lock. The operator screen no longer offers stale approval controls. At scheduled cleanup, cancellation is recorded as withdrawn; an unanswered live proposal is recorded as expired, not as a human decline. Pausing an undecided Safe Mode send fails without stranding its sealed attempt. A repeated customer approval through the ordinary campaign route now returns conflict without changing the admitted job; operator retry behavior remains intact. The 19 focused Safe Mode request and 15 approval-service examples pass. This uses the same hold and the send attempt's authoritative stop signal rather than a second decision record. Nitrosend's `human-scanner` adapter observed GET and HEAD leave a pending hold and delivery admission unchanged; its running-API rehearsal mapped to `http-existing-revision-field` observed mismatched decline → 409 with zero changes, exact decline → 200 and cancellation, replay → 409. Both ran on an isolated local hold against the same canonical scenario manifest. The mismatched value was arbitrary, not a previously valid revision. A completed campaign now refuses a new approval request before creating a hold or notification; its focused request spec passes. These observations do not establish full 0.3 conformance, a concurrent race, or the result of an in-flight commit whose response is lost. | Review the service lock and customer decision path for the first draft. Add real revision, revoked-permission, concurrent-decision and lost-response vectors to the later executable conformance suite. Distinguish acceptance from completion. |
| Campaign billing semantics | The draft Campaign Send Approval contract now excludes additional charges and prepaid debits. Nitrosend checks included email capacity before recording approval and rejects a billable reservation before dispatch; focused refusal, rollback and terminal-recovery specs pass. Both review surfaces show the current allowance refusal. | Prove the included and exhausted-allowance paths in the running send, including an allowance change after approval. Check that no prepaid hold, external usage charge or provider dispatch occurs on the denied path. A paid campaign needs a separate type or version with a declared payment effect and exact amount, cap, currency and funding terms. |
| Private financial dogfood | The owner approved a capped local order; it awaits funding and has queued no work. The saved quote is stale, so the MCP host offers no decision. | Create a fresh exact-terms proposal. Prove verified funding or existing balance, bounded holds, accepted outcomes, charges, unused credit, and failed or abandoned funding without presenting a Checkout session as payment. Keep this contract private until those observations exist. |
| Draft reconciliation | The site, generated draft and shape checks build from the current sources. Contract and other authored JSON now pass the 0.3 lexical I-JSON limits before generation; the browser contribution checker rejects the same invalid contract bytes. Generated examples are checked against the message byte limit. Runtime scenarios remain unimplemented. | Resolve dogfood findings in the canonical text or an explicit support limit, then regenerate and review examples, schemas, contracts and the Internet-Draft together. Link the bounded Nitrosend evidence; keep unimplemented runtime scenarios marked as such. |
| Architecture and threat review | Core delegates execution to existing service interfaces and confines email to signed description plus optional narrow bearer capabilities. The reference receiver accepts original SES S3 MIME from strictly DKIM-aligned senders; its installed action bindings remain first-party. Its extractor rejects duplicate machine-part MIME headers and parameters, unsupported transfer encoding, and a non-readable related root, including an empty `multipart/alternative` root; the stored Mailgun-to-SES original still parses. The first-party inbox bindings now match saved-object, message and inbox brands; a focused cross-brand campaign case exposed no action. MAP human decisions reject ambient cookie-session authentication and require the app's explicit token. A configured local inbound rehearsal now checks SNS signature, exact topic and S3 bucket instead of taking the ordinary development bypass; 20 focused controller/normalizer checks pass. A running local server with the expected topic and bucket returned 403 for an unsigned notification without admitting an inbox job. An original signed SNS callback for a real SES delivery passed the isolated inbound controller and stored a verified MAP message. | Review the actual boundary for forwarded mail, replay, gateways, lookalike origins, prompt injection, URL leakage, sender/recipient changes, tenant isolation, role revocation, scanner GETs and capability misuse. Remove unsupported normative scope instead of adding speculative machinery. |
| Content and UX | The 0.3 reader and catalogue are built from canonical sources. A local browser pass of 19 key routes at 390px and 1440px found no HTTP error, horizontal overflow, duplicate/missing H1 or page-script exception; the built site's internal links resolved. Home, reader, Types and Registry were visually inspected at both sizes. About, Examples, Interfaces, Tools, Contribute, a Registry detail, Payment effect and Search were also inspected at both sizes, at the top and end of each page. A middle-page check of Core, type contracts and a Registry detail found the full Registry JSON schema obscuring the example and implementation status; complete schema and description now sit behind keyboard-accessible disclosures. Both widths opened and closed the schema with Enter without overflow or page errors. The MCP tab, stale-terms demo and contract checker responded correctly in the browser, including rejection of duplicate JSON members. A 5 October source review reread the current public page copy, Core, bindings, Registry rules and four contract sources. It corrected two stale Types references, pinned the MAP 0.2 historical source links and marked older design notes as historical. The site verification and current draft render pass. | Source and rendered routes reviewed for the working-draft candidate. Read back the public pages after deployment and keep claims matched to recorded evidence. |
| Packages | npm is at 0.3.2 and the other four packages are at 0.3.0, all published, verified by public registry readback and listed on the tools page. The Ruby gem passes the same vectors as the TypeScript core, and a randomized cross-check of about 75,000 cases found no divergence. | Move Nitrosend's MAP processing onto the gem. A new Registry type alone triggers no package release. |
| IETF submission | The generated individual `-00` candidate has a 5 October document date. It renders to text and HTML with pinned `xml2rfc`; the only renderer warning is its automatic consensus value for the Standards Track category. Offline `idnits` 3.1.0 submission mode reports zero errors, warnings and comments. Its authors are Kam Low and George Hartley of Nitrosend. It was posted on 8 October 2026 as submission 169964; no venue consultation has occurred. | Consult SML about the email container and DISPATCH about venue; post `-01` only when the specification changes. |

Nitrosend owns its implementation plan in `api/doc/map-aware-inbox.md`; MailSchema
owns the protocol and this release gate. Product code and evidence stay in their
owning repository. Record exact revisions, contract digests, setup and observed
outcomes for passed rows. Planning does not pass any row.

The first isolated Nitrosend database lacked a platform notification brand, so
`Notification::Sender` correctly refused to send. A fresh isolated copy now
records the observed SES `nitrosend.com` identity and a dedicated platform brand.
An owner-only hold went through the normal notification job, sender, durable
message admission and SES to the owner's inbox. The original S3 MIME matched
the saved description, passed independent DKIM checks and entered the local
MAP-aware inbox from a reconstructed receipt. The pending native card and MCP
read path both resolve the current saved hold. Its ordinary links reach a
localhost HTTPS review on this machine; they are not public demo URLs. The
queued notification replay completed with no duplicate message or provider ID.
The exact evidence is in Nitrosend's `api/doc/map-aware-inbox.md`.

The earlier adapter-only delivery established the original signed SNS callback
through the isolated controller. A subsequent product-sender request also
entered through its own original signed callback, with the referenced MIME
matched to the persisted outbound message. Nitrosend's generic receiver trust
check accepts an independently,
strictly DKIM-aligned sender; its installed action bindings remain first-party.
The human-decision guard rejects administrator impersonation and ambient-cookie
authentication. A focused request left the hold pending after an impersonated
approval, while the owner's explicit token could decide it.

The local scanner and HTTP-decision rehearsals now share a snapshot of the
sealed attempt, admission reservations, outbox messages, provider-dispatch
timestamps and send counters. They refuse an already admitted attempt and
compare this ledger before calling a negative path effect-free. The prior
observed HTTP run used the narrower decision-state checks. A fresh pending
hold passed the strengthened `human-scanner` adapter on 5 October:
GET and HEAD returned 200, with the full effect ledger unchanged. After signed
callback capture, the HTTP decision adapter observed an arbitrary mismatched
version return 409 with no changed effects, the exact owner decline return 200
and cancel the send, and a replay return 409 with no further effects. This is
distinct from a formerly valid version superseded by new terms and from
lost-response recovery.

The draft now distinguishes an email's ordinary review link from a verified
service route. DKIM authenticates the sender's claim, not the destination
service. A connected consumer must establish any MAP-promoted route through
its installed binding; an unconnected consumer may show the link with its
actual origin. The `human-unverified-route` runtime scenario remains
unimplemented. Nitrosend's first-party inbox bindings rebuild and compare the
complete description from saved service state before offering native controls;
the ordinary email links remain visible as ordinary links. A focused local
request with an unrelated `human.url` and fixture verification metadata
exposed no native action or review endpoint and left the hold pending. It does
not prove ordinary-link presentation or a real signed hostile message.

The isolated Nitrosend development review first exercised a capped order's
card, human decision and funding boundary with synthetic receipt metadata. A
later provider transport probe delivered an actual MAP MIME message through
Mailgun and SES to an existing test inbox. Its stored original passed
independent DKIM and recipient checks and entered the local native inbox through
an ingress replay; the replay reconstructed the SES receipt from read-only
evidence and did not use the original signed SNS callback. The owner approved
the order's cap in the inbox; the order remained unfunded with no work queued
or usage charge, and no funding was completed. Nitrosend's
`api/doc/map-aware-inbox.md` records the bounded observations. A later
owner-only campaign request followed the product sender, SES, an original signed
callback and the verified native inbox in one isolated local chain. Opening its
fallback link did not decide or queue delivery. A separate owner approval
completed one local-provider campaign send; that fixture did not prove campaign
delivery through a real provider. The later owner-inbox approval completed a
one-recipient campaign through SES, with the matching original in the receiving
S3 store. Payment and independent interoperability remain open;
neither is claimed by the first working-draft release.

**Public framing: actionable email.** MAP describes service actions delivered
by email; a supporting inbox presents and carries out authorized decisions.
Native interaction and ordinary-email review links present the same proposal.
This does not expand Core into an embedded application platform.

**Shared library boundary.** Extract proven, service-independent processing into
the maintained language packages: strict description and contract parsing,
validation, canonicalization, digests, typed structures, bounded MIME helpers
where appropriate, and conformance fixtures. Ruby can also supply description
and MIME construction and reusable version, expiry and operation checks. The
service runs these checks with its own current authorization and state checks
inside the decision transaction. A helper does not make a separate read/write
sequence atomic. Reuse established email authentication libraries or trusted
receiver evidence; do not add a second cryptographic implementation.

Inbox components, accounts, credentials, service bindings, approval records,
workflow storage and transactions stay in implementing products. Host helpers
must require explicit trusted receiver, service and policy interfaces; they
cannot infer authority from mail. A proven fallback-toolbar convention can have
optional helpers and implementation guidance without prescribing a widget
language or inbox layout. Only interoperable obligations enter normative text.
Keep vendor identifiers and product logic out of MailSchema packages and the
specification. Nitrosend should consume the shared Ruby processing once extracted,
not maintain a permanent duplicate. The published JavaScript/TypeScript and Ruby
packages currently implement MAP 0.2; this boundary describes forthcoming 0.3
work. Package development continues; select versions from reviewed compatibility
diffs, and keep catalogue additions independent of Core package releases.

## MAP 0.3 candidate

The specification keeps four separate responsibilities:

| Part | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Core | The email description, contract selection, trust, permission and exact-terms processing. |
| Type contract | The interaction's identity, details, operations, inputs, effects and obligations. |
| Service binding | Mapping those semantics to existing service operations through an independently enabled integration. |
| Registry | Discovery of exact contracts and declared service support, with maintainers, lifecycle and evidence. |

The release preparation is in the local branch. Contract source filenames and
public downloads carry their version, while contract JSON owns identity and
meaning. Registry metadata selects the current version and records lifecycle;
older versions remain downloadable. Service support is stored in one collection,
associated with exact contract versions on type pages and in the catalogue.
Support declarations and observed reports are distinct; built-in services need
no downloadable connector. The site and repository use the same parsers for
contract and service-record contributions. Current contributor, versioning,
governance, security and product guidance matches that shape. The generated
Internet-Draft pins one illustrative contract revision instead of tracking the
changing type collection. Public pages have had a source and rendered-route
language pass; the approved hero remains unchanged.

For the website working-draft release: review the local diff, merge it through
the normal repository path, deploy the verified build, then read back the home,
overview, one versioned contract, Registry catalogue, contribution page and
historical archive on the public domain. The local development preview is
`http://127.0.0.1:4325/`. No package version changes with this release.

Nitrosend production deployment, independent interoperability, the private
financial workflow, full runtime conformance, package releases and IETF
submission are separate follow-ons. The posted individual draft still needs venue
consultation. The 54 runtime scenarios
remain labelled unimplemented; do not present shape checks as runtime proof.

## Gates

- Published versioned artifacts retain their original bytes. Changing a contract's contents requires a new contract version; changing wire or authority interpretation requires a new profile.
- Every package release is verified against the canonical bytes by public readback before the site selects it.
- Implementation listings distinguish a maintainer's support declaration from a report of observed behavior. Reports identify the tested revisions, coverage, evidence and implementation owner.
